                        I started my journey with mathematics and the path till the age of went on in the way of mathematics with lots of struggles in the life in between.
                        In the journey of my life till now, I have learnt quite a few things where it poked me that I am right and also realised some moments that I am wrong.
                        But it's all the part of the journey with up and downs like a sine curve.

                                It is an automated bill monitoring system. Send's the notiﬁcation to the user when he crosses the limit in
                                the usage of electricity.In this repository, you can ﬁnd two models EasyOCR based and the second one is using CV and our model got around 78%
                                accuracy and EasyOCR got around 74% accuracy.
